Matlab-Colony-Analyzer-Toolkit
==============================

A toolkit written in Matlab for quantifying microbial colonies grown on agar plates in a systematic grid.

This toolkit requires the Matlab Statistics Toolbox. 

I recommend going over the turoials in the tutorials/ directory before starting your analysis. 

Also, as this toolkit may still be under development, I suggest getting a github account, watching this repository (click the "watch" button), and making sure your notifications settings are set to send you an email when changes are made. This way you will know when you should upgrade to a newer version.

If you have questions or find bugs, please email me: gbean@ucsd.edu

Good luck!

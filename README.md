Matlab-Colony-Analyzer-Toolkit, Gordon Bean, 2014
==============================

A toolkit written in Matlab for quantifying microbial colonies grown on agar plates in a systematic grid.

This toolkit requires the Matlab Statistics Toolbox. 

I recommend going over the turoials in the tutorials/ directory before starting your analysis. 

Also, as this toolkit may still be under development, please email me so I can add you to the toolkit watch-list. When I make important changes I email this list so everyone knows to update the toolkit. Updating is easy, just call update_matlab_colony_analyzer_toolkit() from the Matlab command line.  

If you have questions or find bugs, please email me: gbean@ucsd.edu

Good luck!
